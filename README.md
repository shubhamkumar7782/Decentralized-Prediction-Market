# Decentralized Prediction Market

## Project Description

A blockchain-based smart contract platform that enables users to create and participate in prediction markets. Users can create markets around real-world events, place Yes/No bets, and automatically receive winnings based on outcomes. The contract uses proportional payouts where winners share the losing side's stakes.

## Project Vision

To democratize prediction markets by removing centralized intermediaries and creating a transparent, fair, and accessible platform where anyone can create or participate in predictions about future events through blockchain technology.

## Key Features

- **Market Creation**: Create prediction markets with custom questions and durations
- **Binary Betting**: Place Yes/No bets with minimum 0.01 ETH requirement
- **Proportional Payouts**: Winners receive stakes plus proportional share of losing bets
- **Transparent Resolution**: Market creators resolve outcomes after betting ends
- **Trustless Execution**: Automated operations through smart contracts
- **Event Tracking**: Full transparency with blockchain event emissions

## Future Scope

1. **Oracle Integration**: Automated outcome verification using Chainlink
2. **Multi-Outcome Markets**: Support more than binary predictions
3. **AMM Integration**: Dynamic odds with automated market makers
4. **Governance Token**: Community-driven platform decisions
5. **Dispute Resolution**: Decentralized arbitration for contested outcomes
6. **Cross-Chain Support**: Deploy on multiple blockchain networks
7. **Mobile dApp**: iOS and Android applications
8. **Market Analytics**: Historical data and prediction tracking
